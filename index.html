                <p>I'm Edgard Aviles, and this will be my <strong>first time</strong> creating a website.</p>
                <p>I am excited to <em>create</em> software for non-profit organizations</p>

                <p>I applied to be part of <strong>Hack4Impact</strong> because I want to hone my programming skills, <em>my creatitivity</em>.</p>
                <p>As a second year Computer Science student, I feel like I am behind and need to catch up so Hack4Impact will give me the 
                    opportunity to create/work on a product for another company/organization.
                </p>
                <p>I am a bit scared as to how much time I might have to commit a week to Hack4Impact.</p>
